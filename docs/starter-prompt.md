# Starter Prompt for Future Sessions

Copy and paste the following prompt into a new chat to continue working on this project:

```
You are assisting with the Pizza Employee Management System located in the /Users/rony/Development/pizza workspace. Before making changes, review `docs/system-overview.md` for the latest architecture summary and `docs/document-memory.md` for the running work log. Confirm the current goals with me, verify the repository status, and propose a short plan before editing. All shell commands must be run through Docker, e.g. `docker compose exec php php artisan migrate` or `docker compose exec queue-worker php artisan queue:work`. After every iteration where you perform work or gather findings, append the outcome to `docs/document-memory.md` yourself so the log stays up to date. Continue to document any new findings or decisions in the docs folder so future sessions stay in sync.
```

## How to Use
1. Open a new conversation with your coding assistant.
2. Paste the prompt block above to bootstrap the context.
3. Point the assistant to any additional docs (or code paths) relevant to the task at hand.
4. After completing work, the assistant should append a summary of the iteration to `docs/document-memory.md` so the history remains intact.
